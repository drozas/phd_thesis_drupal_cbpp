\textbf{The drop is always moving: an ethnographic perspective of Drupal as a Commons-Based Peer Production community}
\end{center}

Common-Based Peer Production (CBPP) is a new model of socio-economic production in which large numbers of people cooperate to create a set of resources in a process driven by the general interest, and favouring reproducibility. Drupal is a free software content management framework sustained by a community of more than 1 million participants. It represents one of the most visible examples of this new model of socio-economic production and its potential to develop complex products with an enormous number of interdependent components. This research concerns individual involvement and group dynamics of Commons-Based Peer Production communities, focussing on the community behind Drupal. It is expected this research could be useful for the Drupal community itself, and the researcher has already disseminated his first set of findings at several events in the community (DrupalCon Barcelona 2015, DrupalCamps, local events, etc.).
