\chapter{List of tensions}
\label{appendix-list-conflicts}

This appendix presents an example of the type of outcomes produced as a result of the process of coding with CAQDAS (see section \ref{organising-caqdas}), in this case related to the identification of tensions from an Activity Theory perspective (see section \ref{subsec:at-conceptualisation}). Similar outcomes were generated, for example, for each of the socio-technical systems of contribution explored.

Description and effects 
\\ \hline \hline

1  & Bonus system to speed up peer reviewing of applications  & PO, DA, QI & \textit{Contributed} projects & Rules $ \leftrightarrow $ artefacts & Closed  & Emergence of new rules and more decentralised autonomous spaces for decision-making  \\ \hline


2  & Bureaucratisation of processes to contribute to core (e.g. automated tests) & PO, DA, QI & \textit{Core} projects & Rules $ \leftrightarrow $ community & Constantly ongoing & Emergence of new practices, and more decentralised autonomous spaces for decision-making \\ \hline


3  & Lack of legitimacy to create regional or national Drupal institutions  & PO, QI & \textit{DrupalCamps} & Rules $ \leftrightarrow $ community & Closed or under negotiation, depending on local conditions & Emergence of more formalised institutions, with clearer borders and an explicit division of labour \\ \hline


4  & Quality assurance in \textit{DrupalCamps}: conflicts of interest and degree in which the process is too rigid or too open & PO, DA & \textit{DrupalCamps}  & Rules $ \leftrightarrow $ community  & Closed in the cases studied, under negotiation in emergent ones & Produced a set of more defined selection criteria to avoid corporations co-opting the event \\ \hline


5  & Quality assurance in early \textit{DrupalCons}: nepotism & DA, QI & \textit{DrupalCons} & Rules $ \leftrightarrow $ community                                 & Closed & In earlier stages it was accepted. However, this kind of behaviour would not be accepted in the current situation. Produced a formalisation of many of the entities, such as rules, division of labour and artefacts \\ \hline


6  & Lack of transparency in selection of cities for \textit{DrupalCons} & DA, QI & \textit{DrupalCons} & Rules $ \leftrightarrow $ object & Seems to be closed, although probably it could re-open in the future & Provoked the creation of mechanisms for transparency and a clearer set of boundaries in rules and division of labour \\ \hline


7  & Backdrop: fork of Drupal core & DA, PO  & \textit{Core} projects & Object $ \leftrightarrow $ community & Open & Due to lack of consensus on the general technical direction of Drupal 8. Produced a new CMS with a smaller new community. However, good relationships (e.g. Backdrop contributors attend and present at Drupal events) \\ \hline


8  & Problems for the local community to deal with the organisation of \textit{DrupalCon} Paris 2009 & QI & \textit{DrupalCons} & Community $ \leftrightarrow $ rules & Closed & Clearer definition of the jurisdiction of the \textit{DrupalCons} in the hands of the Drupal Association. However, according to excerpts from some interviewees, many of these decisions were already taken by them before (e.g. selection of selectors) through invisible hierarchies \\ \hline


9  & Creation of a European Drupal Foundation & PO, DA & \textit{DrupalCons} & Community $ \leftrightarrow $ object                                & Seems to be closed at the moment & The initiative never materialised. However, many Drupalistas still consider the Drupal Association very US-centric \\ \hline


10 & Feeling a free rider, problems recognising other forms of value & DA, PO & All & Artefacts $ \leftrightarrow $ subjects                              & Ongoing & Related to the idea of selective benefits proposed by Dries during his keynote in \textit{DrupalCon} Amsterdam 2014. Related also to the difficulties to acknowledge other forms of value beyond ``object-centric" ones. Ongoing discussion and work to try to reflect these contributions \\ \hline


11 & Transition of some \textit{contributed} projects to core, such as CCK, Views and Twig & DA, PO, QI & \textit{Contributed} projects, \textit{core} projects & Contributed$ \rightarrow $ Core\footnote{\label{fn-3at} Tension between activity systems, conceptualised drawing on the third generation of Activity Theory (see section \ref{subsec:3at}).} & Always ongoing & Examples of transitions of projects from organic towards mechanistic systems. Including cases in which self-organised groups of Drupalistas, who have historically had less power, managed to change the direction of the project \\ \hline


12 & Transition of ideas from local events to \textit{DrupalCamps} and \textit{DrupalCons} & PO, DA, QI & Local events, \textit{DrupalCamps}, \textit{DrupalCons} & Local events $ \rightarrow $ DrupalCamps $ \rightarrow $ DrupalCons\footnote{See footnote \ref{fn-3at}.} & Always ongoing & Several examples (from new proposals of projects to governance of the community) of how, through the participation in events, a set of ideas are extended, discussed and adopted by the community \\ \hline


13 & Recognition of less visible labour in profiles at Drupal.org  & PO, DA & All & Artefacts $ \leftrightarrow $ subjects                              & Ongoing & Related to \#10 \\ \hline



14 & Inclusion of Symfony in core & DA & \textit{Core} projects & Object  $ \leftrightarrow $ community                                                                      & Closed & Related to \#7 \\ \hline


15 & Too much control of large companies & DA, PO & \textit{Core} projects & Community $ \leftrightarrow $ rules                                 & Ongoing & Large companies, most prominently Acquia, accused of having too much control over decision-making of technical direction, by hiring influential developers \\ \hline


16 & Difficult to contribute to core  & PO & \textit{Core} projects  & Rules $ \leftrightarrow $ subjects  & Ongoing & Some Drupalistas felt it is too difficult to contribute to the core, and sometimes their voices are not heard because they do not work for large companies \\ \hline


17 &  Complaints about feeling unrepresented by the Drupal Association  & PO & \textit{DrupalCons} & Community $ \leftrightarrow $ subjects & Ongoing & Generated a debate to call for elections in more positions \\ \hline


18 & Accusations of nepotism in the Japanese community  & PO & \textit{DrupalCamps}   & Subjects $ \leftrightarrow $ rules  & Closed & Due to invisible hierarchies, and lack of structure. It was solved by forking the local community and artefacts \\ \hline


19 & Lack of recognition of themers work & PO  & \textit{Core} and \textit{contributed} projects  & Division of labour $ \leftrightarrow $ artefacts & Ongoing & Related to \#10 \\ \hline


20 & Lack of accountability when deciding to transition a \textit{contributed} module to core: the REST module case & PO & \textit{Contributed} projects, \textit{core} projects & Contributed$ \rightarrow $ Core\footnote{See footnote \ref{fn-3at}.} & Closed & Initiative to discuss why this module was moving into core, and if it was completely necessary. Accusations of doing it just because of interest of large companies.  Generated more formalisation \\ \hline


21 & Professionalisation and outsourcing of certain tasks, rather than leaving the community to do it  & PO, DA & All & Rules $ \leftrightarrow $ community  & Ongoing & Trend to professionalise some of the ``boring" tasks. Some Drupalistas argue it is always better to try to do it by volunteering Drupalistas, since this will foster collective learning \\ \hline


22 & Paid vs unpaid labour in core & DA  & Core  projects & Community $ \rightarrow $ rules & Ongoing & Formalisation of criteria to decide what should be funded \\ \hline


23 & \#Pussygate: resignation of member of Drupal Association committee & DA, PO & \textit{DrupalCons} & Subject $ \rightarrow $ rules  & Closed & Member of the Drupal Association committee resigned after supporting the use of strong language in a tweet by another Drupalista. Provoked large discussions with regards to generating welcoming environments at events. Some European Drupalistas also expressed this could be due to his defence of non-US communities \\ \hline


24 & General suspicion on large companies getting too much influence in core & PO & \textit{Core} projects & Object $ \rightarrow $ community & Ongoing & Related to \#15 \\ \hline


25 & Use of sexist language in presentations & DA & \textit{DrupalCons}, \textit{DrupalCamps} and local events & Rules $ \leftrightarrow $ community  & Closed & Related to \#23. Influenced the creation of a more explicit set of rules and division of labour to enforce them. Decision-making more decentralised via working groups \\ \hline


26 & Developers or site builders first? (in design of Drupal 8 architecture) & DA  & \textit{Core} projects & Division of labour $ \leftrightarrow $ object  & Closed & Discussion about how the artefact (core) should be designed in terms of roles interest \\ \hline


27 & Jurisdiction of resolution of conflicts & DA  & All & DrupalCons$ \rightarrow $ DrupalCamps and local events\footnote{See footnote \ref{fn-3at}.}  & Constantly ongoing & Produced the definition of a clearer division of labour and emergence of codes of conduct. Generating tensions in other systems \\ \hline


28 & Critiques about influence of large corporations (e.g. Acquia) in organisation of the community & DA  & All & Community $ \leftrightarrow $ Rules  & Constantly ongoing & Related to \#15 \\ \hline


29 & Gentrification of the community to contribute due to influence of large corporations  & DA, PO & \textit{Core} projects & Object $ \leftrightarrow $ Community & Ongoing & Related to \#15 \\ \hline


30 & Implementation of selective incentives for companies which contribute more (organisation profiles in Drupal.org)  & DA & Core and \textit{contributed} project  & Artefacts $ \leftrightarrow $ rules  & Ongoing & Related to \#10 \\ \hline


31 & Loss of the hobbyists  & DA, PO & Core and \textit{contributed} projects & Object $ \leftrightarrow $ Division of labour                       & Unresolved, how far the effects will go will be seen in future stages & Due to the changes in the overall architecture, there is a fear this will produce a loss of contributors who start with Drupal just in a ``hacky” way \\ \hline


32 & Speakers at a local event from the same company. Co-opting communitarian spirit & PO & Local events                             & Object $ \leftrightarrow $  rules  & Solved in some local communities, ongoing in others & The way in which it is faced depends on the local conditions, but it ranges from a partial formalisation, towards forking events \\ \hline


33 & Symfony in core: ``Drupal is made by the community, Symfony is made by a company" & DA, PO  & \textit{Core} projects & Object  $ \leftrightarrow $  community & Ongoing & Related to \#31 and \#15. This also was one of the main reasons to fork (see \#7) \\ \hline


34 & Paid vs unpaid labour: becoming an oligarchy of those with free time paid by their companies & PO  & \textit{Core} and \textit{contributed} projects & Community  $ \leftrightarrow $  object & Ongoing & Related to \#15. This is also related to the 1\% issue, becoming more critical as more work is done by few people, and those people are hired by large corporations \\ \hline


35 & Excessive sense of identity: Drupal as a religion & DA, PO  &  All & Community  $ \leftrightarrow $  subjects & Ongoing. & The starting point was the critique to Dries from one of the most active contributors at the time. The problem was discussed by some Drupalistas under the idea of: ``are we working for the community, or are we working for 'the man'?" \\ \hline


36 & Excessive growth: ``better before than bigger" & DA & All & Community  $ \leftrightarrow $  rules & Ongoing, also related to \#15 & The general culture is about growing in number of contributions and contributors, but there is a critique of making the community sustainable with the resources which it already has \\ \hline


37 & ``This is how things are done in Drupal"  & DA, QI  & \textit{Core} and \textit{contributed} projects & Rules $ \leftrightarrow $ Community  & Closed, although under constant negotiation & Refers to social norms promoting lack of questioning on how things are done, which is a powerful argument especially in initial stages with invisible hierarchies. It produced changes significantly increasing formalisation, facilitating a greater participation of Drupalistas in decision-making \\ \hline


38 & Similar projects competing with each other (e.g. Drush vs Console or Organic Groups vs Group)  & DA, PO, QI  & \textit{Contributed} projects & Object $ \leftrightarrow $ object\footnote{See footnote \ref{fn-3at}.} & Constantly ongoing & Refers to the tensions between projects tackling similar issues. Key aspects of the \textit{contributed} system, in which there is competition between similar projects in some occasions. This is argued by Drupalistas as a key source of innovation \\ \hline


39 & Emergence of \textit{DrupalCamps} in Spain (``growing the local community should go first") and legitimacy to do it  & QI  & \textit{DrupalCamps}  & Rules $ \leftrightarrow $ community  & Closed  & During emergence stage some local Drupalistas argue the organisation of a \textit{DrupalCamp} was too complex, and the efforts should be placed instead on having more local events. Produced a division in the group, in which some of the Drupalistas decided to organise the \textit{DrupalCamp} anyway \\ \hline


40 & Security team views on increasing degree  of strictness for PAP & DA  & \textit{Contributed} projects & Division of labour $ \leftrightarrow $ rules   & Closed & Related to \#1 \\ \hline


41 & Forking of a local group & QI & Local events & Rules  $ \leftrightarrow $ object & Closed & Refers to the case of a local community in which many Drupalistas did not agree with the ``de-facto" leader. Produced a fork, with a new local community \\ \hline

42 & Complaints about the theme engine by themers & PO, DA, QI & \textit{Core} projects & Object  $ \leftrightarrow $ division of labour & Closed & Refers to the lack of fulfilment of the needs of themers by the theme engine. Produced the emergence of the ``itch" by which themers organised the core initiative ``Twig in core" \\ \hline
