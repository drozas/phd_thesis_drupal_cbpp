\textbf{Drupal as a Commons-Based Peer Production community: a sociological perspective}
\end{center}

Common-Based Peer Production (CBPP) is a new model of social innovation based on
decentralised collaborative production. Drupal is a free software content management framework maintained and developed by a community of more than 630,000 users and developers. It represents one of the most visible examples of this new model of socio-economic production and its potential to develop complex products with an enormous number of interdependent components.

The main goal of the proposed research consists of analysing the Drupal community from a sociological perspective in order to extract insights related to the dynamics, group decision making procedures, motivations to contribute and mechanisms employed for the economic sustainability of this community.

This work is partially supported by the Framework programme FP7- ICT-2013-10 of the European Commission through the project P2Pvalue (grant no.: 610961).
